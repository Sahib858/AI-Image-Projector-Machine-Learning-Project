# AI-Image-Projector-Machine-Learning-Project
This project can take any image's style and project that style onto any image. For example make any photo look like a Picasso painting. This project was coded in Python using Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, and Tensorflow.

## Notes
Version 1: Can copy any images style and project it so long as they are formatted correctly.

### Future Release
Account for differences in pixelation and resizing so it can copy and project any photo.
